    <p>COCACOLA clusters metagenomic contigs into different "bins", each of which should correspond to a putative genome.</p>

    <p>COCACOLA uses nucleotide composition information and source strain abundance (measured by depth-of-coverage by aligning the reads to the contigs) to perform binning. Further, COCACOLA incoroporates correlation and paired-end read linkage information.</p>

    <p><i>Implemented for KBase by <a href="mailto:sjungbluth@lbl.gov">Sean Jungbluth(sjungbluth@lbl.gov)</a></i></p>
    <p><hr></p>
    <p>COCACOLA takes a metagenome assembly and the reads that produced the assembly and organizes the contigs into putative genomes, called "bins".</p>
    <p><hr></p>
    <p><b>Configuration:</b></p>
    <p><b><i>Assembly Object:</i></b> The Assembly object is a collection of assembled genome fragments, called "contigs".  These are the items that COCACOLA will bin.  Currently only a single Assembly object is accepted by the COCACOLA App.</p>
    <p><b><i>BinnedContig Object Name:</i></b> The BinnedContig Object represents the directory of binned contigs created by COCACOLA. This object can be used for downstream analysis</p>
    <p><b><i>Read Library Object:</i></b> The read libraries are aligned to the assembly using bbmap, and provide the abundance information for each contig that roughly follows the species abundance.</p>
    <p><b><i>Minimum Contig Length:</i></b> Contigs that are too short may slow down analysis and not give statistically meaningful nucleotide composition profiles.  A value of 1000 - 2500 bp is a reasonable cutoff.</p>
    <p><b><i>Contig Split Size:</i></b> Contigs are split before clustering to minimize the bias imposed by very large contigs. A value of 5000-10000 bp is a reasonable cutoff.</p>
    <p><b><i>Contig Split Overlap:</i></b> Contigs split before clustering can have varying degrees of overlap.  A value of 0 is most often used.</p>
    <p><b><i>Kmer Length:</i></b> Size of the kmers used during profiling.  A default value of 4 is reasonable to start with.</p>

    <p><hr></p>
    <p><b>Output:</b></p>
    <p><b><i>Output Object:</i></b>The BinnedContig Object represents the directory of binned contigs created by COCACOLA. This object can be used for downstream analysis.</p>
    <p><b><i>Output Bin Summary Report:</i></b>The number of bins produced, the number of contigs that were binned and the total number of contigs in the assembly.</p>
    <p><b><i>Downloadable files:</i></b> The enitre output of the COCACOLA run may be downloaded as a zip file. This zip file also contains a table of read-depth coverage per contig ("*.depth.txt")</p>
